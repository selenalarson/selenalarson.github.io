I’m sitting here, on day six of a massive cold with my body filled with cold medicine, so please forgive the rambling and stream of consciousness as I attempt to blog about a new adventure on which I’m so pleased to embark.
<p>

(When this happens, some people turn to Medium, which I prefer to keep solely <u><a href="https://medium.com/@selenalarson">dedicated to my fiction writing</a></u>, so by posting this on my personal blog I am Being Unique. Thank you for tuning in.)<p>

As you may have heard, I’m joining <u><a href="http://www.dailydot.com">The Daily Dot</a></u> as a technology reporter. I could not be more excited. Some have noticed that The Daily Dot will have an <u><a href="https://twitter.com/MicahSingleton/status/530784758025179137">all-female full-time staff covering technology</a></u>, which I think is pretty spectacular. The Daily Dot is producing some of the most interesting stories about things happening both on the internet and in our world, and exploring fascinating new areas of the web and technology. The team is amazing and inspiring, and really, can you tell how thrilled I am to be a part of it?<p>

I’ll continue to report on issues including diversity in technology, education, emerging tech, and social issues—all of which are not only important to me personally, but also to broader communities and humanity in general as we all work and grow together. Plus I’ll keep writing about new things happening in the ever-changing world of technology, and whether Apple ever finds a woman to put on its keynote stage. <p>

I do have to say, however, that I will miss the team at ReadWrite. I had a blast there the past year working as the social reporter and writing stories ranging from the <u><a href="http://readwrite.com/2014/10/09/nadella-women-dont-ask-for-raise">cluelessness of tech CEOs</a></u>, to <u><a href="http://readwrite.com/2013/08/27/facebook-internet-org-chicago-smart-communities">Facebook’s Internet.org initiative</a></u>, to <u><a href="http://readwrite.com/2014/04/15/heartbleed-perfect-forward-secrecy-security-encryption">Heartbleed</a></u>, to <u><a href="http://readwrite.com/2014/10/27/twitter-earnings-users-growth-slowing">Twitter’s strategy that it hasn’t nailed down yet</a></u>. <p>

But as much fun as the writing and reporting was, it was the people I worked with who really made it fun to come in to work each day. David, Owen, Helen, Adriana, Lauren and Stephanie are <i>literally the best</i>. <p>

So thank you. <p>

I’ll still be living here in San Francisco, which has been a unique journey of its own. I never thought I would be a technology reporter and being in the heart of it all—or what people assume is the heart of it all here in the Bay Area—has been … eye-opening. I’ve certainly learned a lot about hardware and software and <i>brands</i>, but also the industry’s culture, which isn’t always as innovative or welcoming as it claims to be. The Meritocracy is a farce. <p>

And as hard as it is for people to imagine here in The Heart Of It All, great things are happening outside the Bay Area, too. Builders and makers are building and making things that genuinely change the world all over the world. There are stories to be told from different angles and diverse perspectives in both Silicon Valley and outside the bubble, and I’m stoked to be a person that is empowered to discover and tell those stories. <p>

I hope you continue to read them.
