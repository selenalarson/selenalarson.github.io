I’m not exactly sure why I’m writing this, but after reading and writing a few year in review pieces about other people and things, I figured I should write my own.<p>

Compared to the rest of the universe, 2014 was rather anticlimactic for me. It was the second year I spent in San Francisco, and the first year it felt like I actually had my life together. <p>


2014: The Year Selena Officially Grew Up. <p>


Okay no, I spoke too soon. I’ve still got a ways to go, I think. This year was filled with personal struggles, professional accomplishments, and stronger friendships, but now that it’s come to an end I find myself wondering if I did enough.<p>
 

Was I a good enough person? I hope so. Did I do everything I wanted? Not even close. <p>


I try not to make New Year’s resolutions because I know I’ll never achieve them. Most of the things on those lists I make are grandiose wishes, not resolutions. Things that I want to have happen but realize they probably won’t. Like when I was a child and asked Santa for puppies and a personal television as if he would ever give me one single puppy, let alone four. <p>


There wasn’t anything on my list of resolutions for 2014, but as I look back on my year, I wonder if I would have put most of what happened on a list if I had one. <p>


In an essay <u><a href="http://femsplain.com/when-a-big-city-can-make-a-person-feel-so-small">I wrote for Femsplain</a></u>, I talked about what it’s like experiencing an emptiness when you have no friends. For someone who thrives on positive human relationships, laughter, and hugs, being alone is especially hard. This year I strengthened bonds that began to form in 2013, and I finally feel like I found my people. That small group of humans that is there for me no matter what, who brunch together on Sundays, who travel with me to random places, and who listen to me gripe about shallow things without telling me I’m being ridiculous until I have no words left. <p>


You never really resolve to have more friends, or finding people to love. It sort of just happens. Though I suppose I can check this off the list of resolutions I’m writing after I’ve achieved them.<p>


I don’t really publicly discuss personal events in my life. The Internet doesn’t need to know everything about everyone. My family is equal parts loving and fractured, and perhaps one day they’ll wind up in a book I write. If there was ever a wish I would put on the list of things I wanted this next year, it would be for a person I love to finally be sober. I would give up any potential success I might have for his own. Addiction can destroy a person until all that’s left is the shell of the person they used to be, and the memories you might have together. <p>


See what I mean about unrealistic resolutions? It’s a work in progress, though.<p>


If this wish comes true, I might finally be able to watch Breaking Bad without crying every time Jesse comes on screen. I couldn’t do that in 2014. I tried. <p>


Professionally, I’m happy. <p>


In high school I was awarded a college scholarship that was the only reason I could pay for journalism school. A few weeks ago, I was feeling nostalgic, and reached out to the woman responsible for giving me the scholarship to tell her where I wound up. Minutes later she replied, and I was startled by how clearly she remembered me and how proud she was, even though we hadn’t spoken in years. <p>


I read her email and realized I really do have a lot to be proud of. Writing about technology was never what I envisioned myself doing, but now that I am, I rather enjoy it. One day I might file stories from a war zone like I planned to do in college, but for now, San Francisco is good enough for me. <p>


It feels good to be doing something I love, and apparently people have noticed. On Facebook the other day my friend Amanda said, “Selena, the move to Daily Dot has been fantastic for your writing. I love that you're able to write more personal items, more long form items and items that you clearly care more about. Its great and your writing is really growing.”<p>


She said this about a story I wrote about the plastic surgery I had as a teenager—a story I’ve wanted to write for years but never had the courage, nor opportunity, to write about it until now. In the coming year, I plan to continue writing things I care about and holding people accountable. Being a journalist is pretty spectacular. <p>


Now that I think about it, there is one thing I should put on my list of resolutions: Finally publish the book I wrote. It’s done, but I can’t bring myself to publish it because I’m terrified that people won’t like it. Weird, right? <p>


I’ll publish a summary, though. I’m confident enough to do that. <p>


<i>Quinn just graduated with her Ph.D in biology, and as her friends pair off and get married, she feels stuck. Alone with no job facing the mounting grief and guilt following her grandmother's death, she decides to take a job in Paris, hundreds of thousands of miles away from her home in Arizona. <p>


She will be studying butterflies at the National Museum of Natural History, attempting to manipulate evolution to discover how to turn brown butterflies blue. Her mysterious and volatile lab partner is the handsome Dr. Hunter Wellington, and a darkness hides beneath his hooded green eyes. Quinn develops a complicated relationship with the older woman who runs the museum—Sophia reminds Quinn of her own grandmother. Strong and solemn, with a warmth that only emerges when she thinks no one is looking. <p>


While in Paris, Quinn begins to fall in love with a barista she met at the corner coffee shop. Tomas becomes a crucial friend when an anonymous package is placed under Quinn’s door, that spills secrets of the past right into her lap. <p>

Her grandmother might not be the woman Quinn thought she was, and as she goes on a journey through France that unearths family drama and heartbreak during the pain of World War II, she learns that human nature is just as fragile as the butterfly wings she studies in the quiet coldness of her lab.</i><p>

This year I poured myself into books. I read too many to count, and since you can’t read my book yet, I’ll recommend some of my favorites.<p>

</u>There’s no book I’ve loved more than <u><a href=“http://www.anthonydoerr.com/books/all-the-light-we-cannot-see/“>All The Light We Cannot See </a></u>. I couldn’t stop thinking about it after I turned the final page. It’s a beautiful, heartbreaking journey.</u></ul><p>

I don’t know what 2015 will bring, but I’m looking forward to it. I want to travel more, I want to write more, and I want to be more than I was this year. But I’m not going to add all that to a wish list.<p>

I’m just going to do it. And hope it all works out in the end. <p>
