I’m going to CES for the first time ever, and I have zero expectations. But based on tweets from people who are going and people who have been I can only imagine it’s a terrifying, stressful adventure. <p>

I couldn’t let Molly and Taylor have all the fun this year, so as soon as I started at the Daily Dot, I was all: <p>

It’s now a few days before I’m supposed to leave, and I realize I am completely unprepared. I just went to Walgreens and picked some stuff up—I think now I’m all set. <p>

Taylor and I arrive on Saturday. Along with a bunch of other journalists. As soon as we’re all checked-in to the hotel, editors will fire off some advice.<p>

It’s still early, and the public isn’t there yet. On Sunday I’ll approach the convention center with stars in my eyes.<p>

But then the veteran tech reporters who have done this for years and come prepared with confidence and more resources than just new mascara and Advil will say hello and burst my bubble.<p>

Tuesday arrives.<p>

I’ve never watched CES coverage on any cable news network, but I’m assuming CNN is pre-writing it’s coverage this week. <p>

Day five. My gluten-free rations are all gone. Must scavenge. <p>

Thursday comes along and I just barely make it to my flight home on time. Sitting next to me is a kindly native familiar with the madness that is CES. She asks how my week was. <p>
