I’m going to CES for the first time ever, and I have zero expectations. But based on tweets and advice from people who are going and people who have been, I can only imagine it’s a terrifying, stressful adventure. <p>

I couldn’t let Molly and Taylor have all the fun at CES this year, so as soon as I started at the Daily Dot, I was all: <p>

It’s now a few days before I’m supposed to leave, and I realize I am completely unprepared. I just went to Walgreens and picked some stuff up—I think I’m all set. <p>

Taylor and I arrive on Saturday. Along with a bunch of other journalists. As soon as we’re all checked-in to our hotels, editors will fire off some advice.<p>

On Sunday I’ll approach the convention center with stars in my eyes. It’s still early, and the public isn’t there yet.<p>

But then the veteran tech reporters—who have done this for years and come prepared with confidence and more supplies than just new mascara and Advil—will say hello and burst my bubble.<p>

Tuesday arrives. Along with the meetings.<p>

I’ve never watched CES coverage on any TV news network, but I’m assuming CNN is already pre-writing its coverage. <p>

Day five. My gluten-free rations are all gone. Must scavenge. <p>

Thursday comes along and I just barely make it to the airport on time. Sitting next to me is a kindly Las Vegas native familiar with the madness that is CES. She asks how my week was. <p>
