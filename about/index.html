<div class="biophoto"><img src="/images/selena-serious.jpg"/></div>
<p>I'm a journalist for <u><a href="http://dailydot.com">The Daily Dot</a></u> in San Francisco covering the intersection of technology, culture and social justice. 


<p>With a unique background in journalism and communications across the health, education, technology and economic development fields, I aim to tell stories that advocate for the public good and represent diverse voices that often go unheard. 

<p>Previously, I was the social reporter for <u><a href="http://readwrite.com">ReadWrite</a></u>, a freelance journalist and multimedia producer working as a host for creativeLIVE, writing for publications including VentureBeat, AZ Tech Beat and SheKnows, and as an editorial professional helping small businesses tell their story online. 

<p>My work has appeared in Lifehacker, The Arizona Republic, Business Insider, and others.<p>

I have experience in TV and radio/podcast productions, and I regularly appear on <a href="http://twit.tv"><u>TWiT.TV</a></u> and radio shows including BBC's World Have Your Say and the Australian Broadcasting Company's Future Tense program.<p>


<p>I've worked for the Downtown Chandler Community Partnership, FOX Sports Arizona, and Banner Health. I cofounded the magazine Gateway to the East Valley with my best friend and mentor Jennifer Lindley, and served as the assistant editor for over a year.

<p>In my spare time, I'm writing a fiction novel, <u><a href='https://medium.com/@selenalarson'>a series on Medium</a></u>, and occasionally updating my travel blog, <u><a href='http://www.seekingcities.com'>Seeking Cities</a></u>. My award-winning multimedia pieces include Child Slaves of West Africa, Scars of War and Living the American Dream.

<p>I was an anchor at <u><a href='http://gangplankhq.com'>Gangplank</a></u>, a collaborative workspace in Chandler, Ariz. where I volunteered my time as a public relations consultant for startups and led their student STEM education program, GangplankJr.
